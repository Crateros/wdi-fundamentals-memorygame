        <p>A typical game looks like:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix up the game cards.</li>
            <li>Lay them in rows, face down.</li>
            <li>Turn over any two cards.</li>
            <li>If the two cards match, keep them.</li>
            <li>If they don't match, turn them back over.</li>
            <li>Remember what was on each card and where it was.</li>
            <li>Watch and remember during the other player's turn.</li>
            <li>The game is over when all the cards have been matched.</li>
            <li>The player with the most matches wins.</li>
        </ol>
